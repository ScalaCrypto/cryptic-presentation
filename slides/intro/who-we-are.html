Odd M&ouml;ller has been programming since childhood, first by
stealing his mother's Pascal books, then by making games for his
family to enjoy (or at least help debug).

This was followed by doing labs, assignments and instruction
while at university (KTH). Professionally he started out by doing
enterprisy stuff using Java for about 15 years before seeing the
light in form of the Scala (around 20 years ago).

Trying to contribute something back to the community, he was
involved in the Scala collections revamp for the 2.13 release.
