Odd M&ouml;ller has been programming since childhood, first by
stealing his mother's Pascal books, then by making games for his
family to enjoy (or at least help debug).

This was followed by doing labs, assignments and instruction
while at university (KTH). Professionally he started out by doing
enterprisy stuff using Java for about 15 years before seeing the
light in form of the Scala (around 20 years ago).

Trying to contribute something back to the community, he was
involved in the Scala collections revamp for the 2.13 release.

  <pre><code>Prompt: Describe Odd Möller</code></pre>
  <pre class="fragment" style="font-size: 0.4em;">
Odd Möller is an accomplished Swedish programmer and software engineer with significant
contributions to the Scala programming ecosystem. Here's what characterizes him as a
programmer:

Programming Philosophy & Style:
Lives by the motto "Coding through life, one function at a time", reflecting a functional
programming mindset. Focuses on advanced data structures and performance optimization.
Demonstrates expertise in both theoretical computer science and practical implementation.

Technical Expertise:
Scala Specialist: Made significant contributions to the Scala 2.13 library by developing
and optimizing immutable.TreeSeqMap.

Performance Engineering:
Used JMH (Java Microbenchmark Harness) to compare performance of different immutable.SeqMap
implementations and optimize both performance and memory usage.

Data Structures:
Specializes in immutable data structures and their trade-offs.

Open Source Contributions:
Maintains 104 repositories on GitHub, indicating prolific open-source activity.
Has contributed directly to the Scala standard library. Active in the Scala community
through conference presentations.

Professional Experience:
Previously served as CTO of Traveas AB. Currently works at Youmoni. Educated at KTH Royal
Institute of Technology, one of Europe's leading technical universities.

Community Involvement:
Speaker at Scala Days, presenting on advanced topics like "Immutable Sequential Maps –
Keeping order while hashed". Shares knowledge about complex programming concepts and
optimization techniques.

Odd Möller represents the archetype of a senior functional programmer who combines deep
theoretical knowledge with practical implementation skills, particularly in the Scala
ecosystem where he has made meaningful contributions to the language itself.

      <li>&rarr; Quite the mouthful... :-)</li>
      <li>This basically says that I a long time Scala programmer and that I am
        involved in various open-source projects</li>
      <li>Also, I should add that I'm currently at the Stockholm based IoT company Youmoni doing exciting IoT stuff</li>
