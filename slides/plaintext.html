    Note about encrypting<br>
    <p class="fragment">Only encrypt the secrets</p>

case class PlainText(bytes: Array[Byte],

        Make sure that only the secret is encrypted<br>
        If an adversary knows something about what's encrypted, decryption is easier<br>
        When creating a Codec<br>
        use the PlainText Manifest to store structure.<br>
        The Manifest is not to be encrypted.<br>
