        Invented in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and
        Leonard Adleman<br>
        &rarr; It needs large keys, minimum 2048-bit<br>
        to provide adequate security for current computing capabilities<br>
        &rarr; Max data size is (key size - padding)<br>
        2048-bit handles approximately 245 bytes<br>
        &rarr; It's suitable to use for key exchange<br>
        <br>
        A newer asymmetric crypto is based on Elliptic Curve&rarr; <br>
