    <aside class="notes">
        RSA was invented in 1977 by Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman
        <ul>
            <li>&rarr; It needs large keys, minimum 2048-bit,
                to be considered secure, at least for todays computers
            </li>
            <li>&rarr; It can only handle small data<br>max data size is (key size - padding)<br>
                For example, a 2048-bit key handles approximately 245 bytes of data
            </li>
            <li>&rarr; It's suitable to use for key exchange</li>
        </ul>
        A newer asymmetric crypto is the Elliptic Curve Cyptography&rarr;
